# 30-Hours Challenge

We are hosting an overnight, IRL, Hack competition in Taipei, Taiwan. Bring your thinking caps for a full day (and night) of hack competitions, workshops, mentorships, networking, and swag.

We will be working with protocols to present EXTRA PRIZES for teams or individuals that build the best integrations, front-end features, bots, or bug-fixes in person. Challenges will not be made public, only teams that attend on April 23rd will be able to compete for prizes.
