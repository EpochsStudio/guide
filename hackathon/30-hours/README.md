# 30-Hours Challenge

We are hosting an overnight, IRL, Hack competition in Taipei, Taiwan. Bring your thinking caps for a full day (and night) of hack competitions, workshops, mentorships, networking, and swag.

We will be working with protocols to present EXTRA PRIZES for teams or individuals that build the best integrations, front-end features, bots, or bug-fixes in person. Challenges will not be made public, only teams that attend on April 23rd will be able to compete for prizes.

## FAQ

### I am a challenger, how can I get a team?

**We will register teams right before the challenge starts (2022.4.23 10:00)**. If you didn't find a team yet, you can:

- Shout out for your team mates in Epochs' Discord channel or Telegram group
- Meet other developers at the venue before the registration deadline comes
- Get assigned to random team by Epochs' hackathon working group

### How large is a team size?

Each team can have 4 members maximally (the size of 2 tables)

### Can my team decide which challenge to work on?

Yes, Epochs' hackthon working group will collect your desired challenge (one of Crema/Orca/Serum/Raydium) when you register for your team. However, each challenge has limited attached teams. If the number of the team that registers for a certain challenge exceeds its limitation, then the working group has to randomly re-assign some of the teams to register other challenges.

The limitation depends on the total number of teams. For example, there are 20 teams joining the 30-Hours challenge. So each the challenge will have the limitation of 5 teams (20 teams / 4 challenges).
