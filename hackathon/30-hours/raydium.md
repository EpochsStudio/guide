# 30-Hours Task - Raydium

## 1. Description of the Task

**Use Raydium’s SDK and open source frontend to develop a DApp or function that leverages one or more of Raydium’s features.**

This could include swap, adding/removing liquidity, farms or staking. Some examples may include:
  - A swap modal, plug-in, or UI that is easily integrated by other platforms/projects that want to provide their users with an in-app or in-site swap. Could have full swap features, or allows any token to be swapped for the project’s own token or selected token(s). 
  - A “Zap” function or modal enabling users to swap from any token into any two other tokens and add liquidity to a pool
  - A compounding function or bot that harvests and compounds farming rewards, or harvests RAY and stakes into single-sided staking

## 2. Description to the Package

## 4. What are the Nice-to-Haves?
