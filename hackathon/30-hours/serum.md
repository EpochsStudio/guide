# 30-Hours Task - Serum

## 1. Description of the Task

1. mproved swap interface on Serum
 
Serum has open-sourced a very basic swap interface to convert serum liquidity to specific swap prices.  There are many possible improvements to the UI, such as a comparison against Pyth Network or CoinGecko prices, or better info for the user on the relationship between size and slippage.

2. Serum trading strategies to provide liquidity within EMA-defined bands

Serum trading bots that implement a specific strategy (i.e “provide liquidity 5% above and below the 30 minute moving average"). Users would have the ability to deposit funds into the protocol, choosing from a few reasonable choices of parameters (EMA length, market depth, etc.) The strategy would ideally reference Pyth Network for pricing

## 2. Description to the Package

Serum is a protocol and ecosystem that brings unprecedented speed and low transaction costs to decentralized finance. It is built on Solana and is completely permissionless. Ecosystem partners can compose with Serum’s on-chain central limit orderbook to share liquidity and power markets-based features for institutional and retail users.

Can select between:
- Improved swap interface on Serum
- Serum trading strategies to provide liquidity within EMA-defined bands

## 3. What are the Must-Haves?

Build or create decentralized apps on the Solana blockchain with Serum’s liquidity infrastructure

## 4. What are the Nice-to-Haves?

Serum core team is interested in defi projects that build innovative solutions on decentralized liquidity infrastructure and the newly released Serum Core, to increase volume and provide better liquidity to the Solana ecosystem.

## 5. **Judging Criteria**

- Matching to the description track
- Execution (solution has to be working, solve one or more business problems, and be economically viable )
- Code quality and technical documentation (solution should have clean code base with documentation)
