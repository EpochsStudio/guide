# 30-Hours Task - Crema

## 1. Description of the Task

Any static AMM algorithms can be approximated by a custom liquidity provision strategy involving multiple positions on Crema’s CLMM protocol.

Build an algorithm simulator tool based on Crema using Crema’s open sdk that helps users to provide liquidity easily and flexibly.

## 2. Description to the Package

An SDK for replicating different static AMM algorithms on Crema's tickerspace.

## 3. What are the Must-Haves?

Build an algorithm simulator tool based on Crema which can simulate different static AMM algorithms such as Curve Finance, Balancer and others.

## 4. What are the Nice-to-Haves?

- Have a user-friendly front-end web page that can simulate different static AMM liquidity algorithms with one click.
- If your tool can adequately illustrate the model comprehension of Crema

## 5. **Judging Criteria**

- Ease of use for users (how easy is it to understand what that particular algorithm means, and how easy is it to provide liquidity on Crema with this tool?)
- Analytical Insight (does this tool help users derive new understanding about Crema’s programmability  and the Solana ecosystem?)
- Accuracy and stability (How does this tool guarantee robustness and atomicity during operation?)
